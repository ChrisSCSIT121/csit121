    <h1>The Fighting Game Glossary</h1>

    <h2>What is this site?</h2>
    <p><a href = "https://glossary.infil.net/">The Fighting Game Glossary</a> as the name would suggest is a glossary for<br>
       common and niche terminology from a variety of fighting games. The target<br>
       audience for this site are fighting game players of any skill level who want<br>
       to learn more about fighting games. The cite also includes video examples<br>
       along with the terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Organization</h2>

    <p>Fighting Game Glossary is a hierarchicaly organizaed site that is easy to<br>
       understand at first glance. The first thing to catch your eye will likely be<br> 
       the search bar in at the center of the screne that allows users to quickley<br>
       find terms they're looking for. Below the search bar are two filter options.<br>
       One filters by starting letter and the other filters by game franchises each<br>
       of which has their own unique logo. This also helps the useablity of the<br>
       cite.
    </p>

    <p>The cite also makes sure to Contrast terminology from normal text<br>
       as all terms are in big bold orange text. Terms are even labled from <br>
       which franchise they orgiginated from or are commonly used in.<br>
       In case the brightness on the site is too little or too much there's<br>
       a light and dark mode toggle to the right of the serach bar. 
    </p>

    <h2>Audit Score</h2>
    <p>This personally surprised me but The Fighting Game Glossay scored<br>
       a low 38 on the accessibility Checker. The low score is because of a<br>
       lack of accessibility options for blind, deaf, and low vision users. 
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The goal of The Fighting Game Glossary is to be an easy to access and<br>
       simple to use source for fighting game terminology and it does a great<br>
       job at being just that. The layout is simple and intuitive and terms are<br>
       never more than a click and a scroll away from being found. One of<br>
       my favorite details of the cite is the inclusion of video examples as<br>
       it both helps in building better understanding of a term and is also a<br>
       way to keep users engaged with the cite and the information being<br>
       presented. Something I would like to see improved about the cite apart<br>
       from accessbility for blind and deaf people is allowing users to use<br>
       both filter options at the same time as currently it's only filter by letter<br>
       or filter by game franchise.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, The Fighting Game Glossary is a fantastic cite that I would<br>
       recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about fighting games.</p>
